# PacMan_Game

*ABSTRACT*
               Main aim of this Mini Project is to illustrate the concepts and usage of pre-built functions in OpenGL as well as creating user defined functions where necessary.  The maze of the Pac-Man is built using two matrices to avoid depth complexities. One matric is for the walls and the other is for the pebbles. The Pac-Man is appended to the maze by checking for collision between the Pac-Man and the wall. Collision detection is also used to check the collision between the Pac-Man and the ghost. Other operations supported are the transformation operations like translate, rotate and scaling, these help the Pac-Man (and the ghosts) move around the board. Keyboard is the only input device used in this project.

Overview  
               This project is a recreation of the arcade game “PAC-MAN”. It has been implemented on Windows platform. The  package designed here provides an interface for the users for handling the display and manipulation of Pac-Man Movements.
User-Interface 
               The interface is mainly concentrated on the use of keyboard. 
Purpose 
               The aim of this project is to develop graphic package which support basic operation which include building a 3D graphic OpenGL. The package must have a user-friendly interface. The objective of developing this model was to design and apply the skill we learnt in class. 

SCOPE 
               It is developed in CODEBLOCKS. It has been implemented on WINDOWS platform. The  3-D graphics package designed here provides an interface for the users for handling the display and manipulation of  Pac-Man  Movements. The Keyboard is the main input device used.
